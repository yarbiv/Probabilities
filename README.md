# Probabilities
School project. Simulation of dice rolling and blackjack over several questions.

#Dice.cpp
Question 1: Distribution of dicerolls over different amounts of rolls.
Question 2: How many times will the low rolls of a dice equal to the high rolls of a dice over 100 rolls? Sampled 100,000 times.
Question 3: Distribution of the sum of 2 dicerolls. Sampled 100,000 times.

#Cards.cpp
Question 4: Samples different thresholds (from 10-20) to stop hitting at. Simulates 10,000 times each. Outputs probability of busting at each threshold.
Question 5: Card counting. Uses the 'best' threshold (chosen as 17) and Hi-Lo card counting to see how often the dealer will be beat.
